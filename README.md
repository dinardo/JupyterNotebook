# MyJupyterNotebook
This repository is intended as a first test for implementing a `JupyterNotebook`: 
[let's start](FirstPage/myFirstJN.ipynb)

To run the code interactively there are different options, you can:
- Use [Binder](https://mybinder.org) for an interactive environment:

- Use Google [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Clone the git repository locally on your computer and use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
